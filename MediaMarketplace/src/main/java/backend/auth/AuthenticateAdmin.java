 * Annotation to secure methods by requiring the user to have the 'ADMIN' role.

 * {@link PreAuthorize} annotation to enforce this role-based authorization.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Methods annotated with {@code @AuthenticateAdmin} will only be accessible to users
 * with the 'ADMIN' role, ensuring that sensitive operations can only be performed by
 * authorized personnel.
